# Mary Marino Project Data
### Last updated: 2023-09-19 for Week 4 Assignment

**Name:** RDSLR

**What is it?**
* Rd is the lab strain of *Haemophilus influenzae*, a bacterium that normally resides in the nasopharynx of healthy individuals.
* Several factors, including bacterial genetics, can result in *H. influenzae* being capable of causing disease.
* In a pangenome-wide study of *H. influenzae* strains, genes containing Sel1-like repeats (SLRs) were found to be associated with being isolated from disease (1).
* The data presented in this project pertains to *H. influenzae* strains either containing (clinical isolates, mutants) or not containing (Rd) SLR genes
* Files contained within this data folder include several strains and several conditions under which genetic and phenotypic differences will be uncovered through this project and my continuing work in the Mell Lab at Drexel University.

**Where I found it:**
* This data was generously shared with me by Leanie Williams, another member of the Mell Lab at Drexel University.
 
**Relevant references:**
1. "Characterization and modeling of the Haemophilus influenzae core and supragenomes based on the complete genomic sequences of Rd and 12 clinical nontypeable strains" – https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17550610/

**How the files are organized:**
* Files are named and organized according to:
	* The strain being studied (example: RdKW20, GC594, 86028Np, etc.)
	* The condition under which the strain was examined (example: biofilm, supernatant, log phase,  planktonic, etc.)
* All files are fastq.gz format and were originally viewed and manipulated in R
